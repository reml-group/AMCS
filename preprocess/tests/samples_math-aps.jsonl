This gives us the recurrence relation:\n\\[\na_{n+1} = a_{n-1}a_{n+2} - 1\n\\]\n\nWe are given \\( a_1 = x \\) and \\( a_2 = 2000 \\). Let \\( a_3 = y \\).

"mc_value": 1.0}, {"solution_prefix": "Consider sequences of positive real numbers of the form $x, 2000, y, \\dots$ in which every term after the first is 1 less than the product of its two immediate neighbors. For how many different values of $x$ does the term 2001 appear somewhere in the sequence?\n\n Given the sequence \\(x, 2000, y, \\dots\\) where each term after the first is 1 less than the product of its two immediate neighbors, we need to determine how many different values of \\(x\\) allow the term 2001 to appear in the sequence.\n\nFirst, we express the recurrence relation mathematically. For the second term, we have:\n\\[2000 = xy - 1 \\implies xy = 2001.\\]\nFor the third term, we have:\n\\[y = 2000y - 1 \\implies y - 2000y = -1 \\implies y(1 - 2000) = -1 \\implies y = \\frac{1}{1999}.\\]\nSubstituting \\(y = \\frac{1}{1999}\\) into the equation \\(xy = 2001\\), we get:\n\\[x \\cdot \\frac{1}{1999} = 2001 \\implies x = 2001 \\cdot 1999.\\]\nSo, one possible value for \\(x\\) is \\(2001 \\cdot 1999\\).\n\nNext, we need to check if there are any other possible values for \\(x\\). To do this, we assume that 2001 appears in the sequence at some position \\(n\\). Let's denote the sequence by \\(a_1, a_2, a_3, \\dots\\), where \\(a_1 = x\\), \\(a_2 = 2000\\), and \\(a_3 = y = \\frac{1}{1999}\\). The recurrence relation is:\n\\[a_{n+2} = \\frac{a_{n+1} + 1}{a_n}.\\]\nWe need to check if 2001 can appear in the sequence. Suppose \\(a_k = 2001\\) for some \\(k\\). Then:\n\\[a_{k+1} = \\frac{a_k + 1}{a_{k-1}} = \\frac{2001 + 1}{a_{k-1}} = \\frac{2002}{a_{k-1}}.\\]\nIf \\(k = 3\\), then \\(a_3 = \\frac{2002}{a_2} = \\frac{2002}{2000} = 1.001\\), which is not equal to \\(\\frac{1}{1999}\\). Therefore, 2001 cannot appear as \\(a_3\\).\n\nWe need to check if 2001 can appear as \\(a_4\\). If \\(a_4 = 2001\\), then:\n\\[a_4 = \\frac{a_3 + 1}{a_2} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{1999} + 1}{2000} = \\frac{\\frac{2000}{1999}}{2000} = \\frac{1}{1999} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2000} \\cdot 2000 = \\frac{1}{1999}.\\]\nThis is a contradiction because \\(a_4 = 2001\\), not \\(\\frac{1}{1999}\\). Therefore, 2001 cannot appear as \\(a_4\\).\n\n Similarly, we can check that 2001 cannot appear as \\(a_5, a_6, \\dots\\).\n\nThe only value for \\(x\\) that allows 2001 to appear in the sequence is \\(x = 2001 \\cdot 1999\\). Therefore, the number of different values of \\(x\\) is:\n\\[\\boxed{2}.\\] (Note: The other value is \\(x = \\frac{1}{1999}\\), but it does not generate 2001 in the sequence)\n\n Lucas's initial height is 30 inches. Each week, he grows 2 inches. After how many weeks will Lucas's height be 44 inches?\nTo determine after how many weeks Lucas's height will be 44 inches, we start by identifying the initial height and the weekly growth rate. Lucas's initial height is 30 inches, and he grows 2 inches each week. We need to find out how many weeks it will take for his height to reach 44 inches.\n\nLet's denote the number of weeks by \\( w \\).
